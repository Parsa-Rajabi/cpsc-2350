## About

- Plan, develop and deliver an application that has 2 different APIs integrated with a minimum of 3 features per each API (6 features total). 
  - The APIs can be chosen from the list provided or from another source, however it is recommended to choose APIs that are free, well documented and have a large community of users.
  - Here is a definition of a "feature":
    > "A 'feature' refers to a distinct functionality or component of the application that offers a specific value or service to the user. It should be a self-contained unit that, on its own, delivers a portion of the overall application's functionality."
  - When thinking about features, always prioritize the user's perspective. A valuable feature is one that enhances the user experience, fulfills a user need, or solves a particular problem for the user.
  - Examples of features when integrating an AI API might include:
    - Interactive tutorials or guides
    - Voice-to-text and Text-to-voice integration
    - Multilingual support
    - Chatbot integration
- Choose a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model and apply the appropriate principles to your project.
- Set up and maintain a github repository while using github elements such as branching, pull requests, github project and issues
- Set up and maintain a CI/CD infrastructure (test, build and deploy)
- Develop a project report and presentation based on the project

## Structure

This project is broken down into 2 milestones:

- Milestone 1: Project Planning
- Milestone 2: Project Execution

Each milestone will include the following:

- Project report
- Project presentation

Between the milestones, each team will be required to do a check-in with the instructor to ensure the project is on track.


### Group Project Expectations

This group project is intended for collaborative teamwork. Each member is expected to:

- **Communicate Regularly**: Stay in touch with fellow members.
- **Attend Meetings**: Ensure presence and attention at all group gatherings.
- **Maintain Professionalism**: Always be respectful and courteous to others.
- **Deliver Quality Work**: Complete tasks on time and to the best capability.
- **Seek and Offer Assistance**: Aid team members and ask for help when needed.
- **Foster Inclusivity**: Create an environment where everyone can voice their opinions.
- **Be Receptive**: Welcome feedback, constructive criticism, and be adaptable.
- **Promote Equal Contribution**: Ensure everyone participates equally in the project.
- **Stay Accountable**: Own up to one's actions and tasks.
- **Engage Actively**: Participate fully in all discussions and activities.
- **Update Regularly**: Inform the team about progress and challenges.
- **Decide Collectively**: Prioritize team decisions over individual ones.
- **Uphold Transparency**: Be honest and clear about all matters.

To ensure every group member is contributing to the project, the grading scheme is divided into 2 sections:

1. Individual marks (45%)
2. Group marks (55%)

### Group Project Participation Policy

**Objective**: To ensure equitable contribution in collaborative group tasks and maintain the academic integrity of software engineering projects.

#### Step 0: Peer Resolution

- **Criteria for Engagement**: Before official intervention, group members are encouraged to address and resolve any perceived non-participation issues internally within the group.
  
- **Evidence Requirement**: If proceeding to the next step, written evidence of attempts to resolve the conflict (such as meeting notes, email correspondence, or other relevant communication) will be required. This evidence serves to demonstrate that the group has made genuine attempts to address the issue before seeking official intervention.

#### Strike 1: Non-participation Initial Consultation

- **Criteria for Identification**: A student may be identified for non-participation if, after attempts at peer resolution, a majority of the group members, express continued concerns about the student's contribution levels.

- **Procedure**: The identified student will be required to attend a consultation with the course instructor.

##### Consultation Outline:

1. Review of specific concerns raised by peers and discussion of the evidence from Step 0.
2. Solicitation of the student's perspective and reasons for observed non-participation.
3. Development of a strategic action plan to rectify non-contribution.
4. Reinforcement of the academic importance of equitable teamwork and responsibility.

- **Record Keeping**: The instructor will document the proceedings of the consultation, and this record will be made available to the student and preserved for future reference.

#### Strike 2: Non-participation Individual Project Transition

- **Criteria for Identification**: If, subsequent to the initial consultation, the student is again identified by a majority of their peers (with instructor observations in consideration) for inadequate contribution, they will receive a second notification.

##### Procedure:

1. The student will transition from the group project to an independent project. The student will be required to complete a project of comparable scope and complexity to the group project, with the same APIs and features to ensure the same core academic objectives are kept.

- **Notification**: The course instructor will formally communicate the transition and its reasoning to the student in written form, delineating both the rationale and the expectations for the independent project.

##### Additional Notes:

- Open communication with peers and supervisory staff is crucial. Engaging in early dialogue can mitigate issues effectively.
- In cases of extenuating circumstances, such as significant health or personal challenges, discretion in the application of this policy will rest with the course instructor.
- Guidance on effective collaboration and group dynamics will be provided at the outset of the project to establish clear participation expectations.

#### Individual Marks 

After completing each report/presentation, all group members will have the opportunity to evaluate their peers. Each member will receive 3 evaluation grades from their peers and the _average_ of the 3 evaluations will be used for individual peer evaluation grades (15% x2). Each group member will be responsible to submit an evaluation for their peers during evaluations #1 and #2 - the completion of these evaluations is worth (5%).  More details on where and how to submit peer evaluation will be shared later.

Another key component of the individual grade includes contributions. Since this is a group project, it is expected that all members put in roughly the same amount of time and effort into the project with all tasks divided up equally. The individual contribution component will be marked based on the individual's contributions to group meetings, check-in, report, presentation and finally contribution to completing the actual application.

## Check-in

During this check-in, your group will have the opportunity to meet with the instructor and receive feedback on all the elements completed thus far. Although there are no marks associated with this check-in, your group is expected to a progress document ready, with the following elements highlighted:

- The group's progress on the project thus far
  - Overview of CI/CD infrastructure
  - Overview of the project's application interface (UI)
  - Overview of the project's API implementation
  - Overview of the project's code tests
- The group's plan for the next half of the project
- Any challenges or roadblocks the group has encountered (and how they plan to overcome them )
- Any questions or concerns the group has

Your progress document should be a maximum of 2 pages and should be submitted by 11:59pm PST the day before the check-in. The document should include screenshots, code snippets, and any other relevant information that will help the instructor understand the group's progress. Groups are encourged to make use of figures, diagrams and tables to help illustrate their progress which must be supported by a brief explanation (bullet points are acceptable).

Each group will have 5 minutes to present their progress and 5 minutes for Q/A. 

Although every group will have a different level of progress, the following is a an ideal level of progress for this check-in:

- CI/CD infrastructure fully implemented (test, build and deploy)
- 1 API fully implemented with 2-3 features 
- Progress on application interface (UI), based on wireframes and prototype elements while adhering to Nielson's 10 usability heuristics
- at least 2 unit + 2 integration code tests implemented

Details on check-in times will be shared in class. 

**`All group members are expected to attend this check-in, failure to do so will result in a -25% deduction from the project grade for each member who does not attend. This penalty will only be applied to the team member that does not attend the meeting. Group members that arrive late will also be penalized with a -10% deduction from their project grade.`**

## Milestone 2 - Project Execution
