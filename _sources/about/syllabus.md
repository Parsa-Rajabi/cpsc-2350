### Assignment/Project/Lab Policy

- You may not send the instructor or the TAs draft assignments/project/labs for feedback – post all questions to Slack so that everyone can benefit from the answers
- Assignments/labs/projects may be shared/shown in class and online (with no student name/ID)

### Remarking Policy

If you feel a course item has been significantly incorrectly assessed you may request a re-marking. However, before you do make such request, please follow the steps below:

1. Review the marking rubric and ensure you understand the marking scheme.
2. Review the marking comments and ensure you understand the feedback.
3. Schedule a meeting with the TA/Marker to discuss the feedback and marking.
4. If you still feel the marking is incorrect, you may request a re-marking.

#### Request a Remarking

Requests must include a written case for the re-marking and be submitted to the course instructor within 2 business days from receiving the mark.

The item will be re-marked in their entirety by both the course instructor and the TA marker and may result in a higher, unchanged, or lower mark overall which will be final. You should exercise caution in submitting a remark request purely on the hope of getting a minor grade bump as this often does not work out the way a student hopes for.

Each student may submit one remarking request for the term.

## Passing Criteria

```{include} syllabus_bits/passing_requirement.md
```

## Late Policy and Missed Assignments/Exams

All course elements (including but not limited to) assignments, labs and in-class activities, midterm, quizzes and projects are required to be submitted or completed by the specified due dates. Inability to adhere to these deadlines will lead to a score of zero. 

Not submitting an assignment/lab/project github link on D2L Brightspace (even if it was submitted to github on time) will result in a 25% penalty. 

Exceptional situations are considered on an individual basis, subject to the approval of the instructor and supported by legitimate documentation.
